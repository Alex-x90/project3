Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This site is an application that serves as a menu/ordering site for pinocchios pizza in boston. Anyone can go to the page's main site where they can see the menu. There people can register and login,
once they are logged in they can add items to their cart and go to their cart. At their cart they can view their curent order and place that order, which sends it to the server and stores it in a sqlite3
database. Anyone that has superuser priveleges in the application can also go to /orders to view all the current orders. People with superuser priveleges can also go to /admin to add new items to the
menu, new toppings for pizzas and to manually edit the orders database.
